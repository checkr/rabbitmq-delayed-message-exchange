rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange

This container is built using official rabbitmq tag `3.6-management` as base and adding the [rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange) plugin.

**`rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange` plugin is [fairly mature](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange#project-maturity), but be aware of it's [limitations](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange#limitations).**
